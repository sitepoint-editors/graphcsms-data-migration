# GRAPHCMS DATA MIGRATION

## Introduction

Simple utility for migrating data to a [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) project database.

## How to Run

1. Go to the folder data and update the `csv` files with your own data
2. Create a `.env` file and populate it with the following settings:

```env
ENDPOINT=<YOUR_API_ENDPOINT>
TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```

For the Token, create a new one if you don't have from your [GraphCMS](https://app.graphcms.com) dashboard(settings page). For permission, make sure to set it as `OPEN` to allow for both READ and WRITE operations. You'll find your `ENDPOINT` on the same page too,

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the script

After you have supplied your data in the `data/*csv` files, execute the following commands in order:

```bash
npm run categories
npm run posts
```

If you wish to clear out your database contents, you can execute the following command:

```bash
npm run reset
```

This will clear out content for Categories, Posts and Comments.
